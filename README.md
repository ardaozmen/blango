### Overview

This repository is part of my coursework for the "Advanced Django: Introduction to Django Rest Framework" course on Coursera. This blog application serves as a great example for learning the Django Framework. It features numerous functionalities that a blog would require, such as creating posts, adding comments, and managing users.
The aim of this project is to advance the Django blog application developed in the cloud-based Codio environment, for learning and development purposes. It is an enhanced blog application.

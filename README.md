## Overview

This repository is part of my coursework for the "Advanced Django: Mastering Django and Django Rest Framework Specialization" course on Coursera.

It features numerous functionalities that a blog would require, such as creating posts, adding comments, and managing users.
The aim of this project is to advance the Django blog application developed in the cloud-based Codio environment, for learning and development purposes. It is an enhanced blog application.
